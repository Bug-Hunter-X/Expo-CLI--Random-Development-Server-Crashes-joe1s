# Expo CLI Random Server Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server randomly crashes without providing any error messages in the console. This issue significantly disrupts the development workflow.

## Bug Description

The Expo development server unexpectedly terminates during development, making debugging challenging due to the lack of informative error messages.  The crashes appear to be random and not tied to any specific action within the application.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd expo-server-crash`
3. Install dependencies: `expo install`
4. Run the development server: `expo start`
5. Observe the server for random crashes.  The frequency of crashes may vary.

## Solution

The solution file (`expoBugSolution.js`) demonstrates how to implement improved error handling, although the root cause might reside within the Expo CLI itself, requiring further investigation or updates from the Expo team.  Refer to the solution for more details.

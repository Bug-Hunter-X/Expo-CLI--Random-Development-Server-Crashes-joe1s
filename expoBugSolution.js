While a definitive solution for the random crashes within Expo CLI requires further debugging, a strategy to improve error reporting and resilience in your app can be implemented. The following code includes enhanced error handling, which might help reveal more information about potential error sources:

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js

import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

function App() {
  try {
    // Your app logic here
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>This is my App</Text>
      </View>
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('App Error:', error);
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>An unexpected error occurred.</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

This modified app will now catch any exceptions thrown during the application's execution and provides more detailed error messages to the console. Although it doesn't solve the underlying Expo CLI issue directly, it adds a layer of resilience to your application.
